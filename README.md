#**Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Project**
Project Description
Rental bikes have been introduced in many urban cities to enhance mobility comfort. It is crucial to make rental bikes available and accessible to the public at the right time to reduce waiting time. Hence, predicting the bike count required at each hour is essential for a stable supply of rental bikes in the city.

The Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction project aims to predict the demand for shared bikes in Seoul based on various features, including temperature, rainfall, season, and snowfall. The project involves the following five key stages:

Defining the problem
Data processing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Modeling
Evaluation and deployment
Data Processing
After understanding the data, the project involved cleaning and preparing the data for modeling. The team wrangled the data and engineered new features, such as creating columns for month and weekdays to gain a better understanding of how different factors influence bike rentals in Seoul.

The team also performed one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables to a more predictable format and checked for multicollinearity to avoid redundancy in the model. To optimize the model's performance, they transformed the variables to a standard scalar using z-score transformation.

EDA
The EDA stage helped to identify relationships between the dependent variable, 'Rental Bike Count,' and independent variables such as temperature, rainfall, and functioning day. The team discovered that rented bikes are less used in winters than in summers, and functioning day is a crucial factor in determining the number of bikes rented.

The team also identified that some columns contained outliers that could affect the models' performance. Therefore, they took steps to address the issue by removing the outliers.

Modeling
The team split the dataset into training and testing sets and applied multiple linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, elastic net, polynomial regression, decision tree, and random forest to develop models. They used adjusted R2 and RMSE as evaluation metrics.

Evaluation and Deployment
The results showed that the Random Forest model outperformed other models, with the highest adjusted R2 score. The team used model explainability to ensure the model's transparency and interpretability, making it ready for deployment.

Conclusion
The Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction project demonstrates best practices in data science projects, including understanding the problem and data, applying data processing techniques, performing EDA, evaluating and selecting models, and ensuring transparency and interpretability. The project's success shows the importance of data-driven decision-making in enhancing mobility comfort in urban cities.
